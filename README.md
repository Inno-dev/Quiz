Requirement

The quiz must contain 7 questions.
In addition to answering questions for the quiz, the user must also be able to change the appearance of the page between dark mode (ie dark background color with light text) and light mode (light background color with dark text).
Three questions must consist of a statement. Under the statement there are two answer options: true and false.
Three questions should have three answer options.
A question must be answered with checkboxes (at least four answer options). To get this question right, all the correct answer options need to be filled in, neither more nor less.
If the answer was correct or not, it should not be printed immediately when the user selects an answer option.
At the bottom of the quiz there should be a button with the text "Get results!". When clicked, it should show how many correct the user had (should be printed in the DOM). If the user is more than half right, the message should be in orange. If the user is all right, the message should be in green. Otherwise, the message should be in red.
The task will be uploaded to Github. You need to make at least three commits during the work.
